# 09_make_plots

The scripts in this folder were used to make the plots in the study

* `01_Fig1A.R` - creates Figure 1A in the main text (map of sampling locations).
* `02_Fig2_manhattan_plots_XtX_CON001_IHS.*` - `02_*.sl` calls the R script and makes Figure 2 of the main text.
* `02a_manhattan_plots_all_MAC10.*` - `02a_*.sl` calls the R script and makes manhattan plot of all the outlier statistics for the MAC10 dataset.
* `02b_manhattan_plots_all_MAC3.*` - `02b_*.sl` calls the R script and makes manhattan plot of all the outlier statistics for the MAC3 dataset.
* `03_Fig3_chr8keyoutlierregion_XtX_C2_IHS_AF_withgenetracks.R` - creates Figure 3 in the main text.
* `03_SMplot_chr8keyoutlierregion_XtX_C2_IHS_DP_AF.R` - creates Figure Sx.x in the supplementary material. 
* `04_Fig4_EHHS_selected_vs_random.R` - makes EHHS plots of different populations at selected site vs random site. This creates Figure 4 in the main text and Figure Sx.x in the supplementary material.
* `05_Fig5_chr8keyoutlierregion_haplotype_structure_SV.R` - creates Figure 5 of the main text.
* `06_plot_IHS_IHH_with_vs_without_SV.R` - creates Figure Sx.x in the supplementary material.
